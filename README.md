## VALENTINE'S DAY :cupid:

The site is for students of Ala-Too International University, where they can confess to each other in romantic, platonic and other ways by sending appropriate heart. There is ***red*** heart that you can send to ones you love, ***pink*** heart for your friends and ***beige*** for those who you want to become acquainted with
